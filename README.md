# atom-remove-keybindings-collisions package

Allows you to remove those keybindings from other packages that starts like yours or share the same keystrokes.

## Usage
If you select the 'Exact Keystrokes' it will remove only those keystrokes that are identically but if you leave the checkbox unchecked it will match partial keystrokes. For example it will match yours 'ctrl-k j' with the keystroke 'ctrl-k ctrl-l' from other package. This increases the performance when Atom it is looking for similar keystrokes.
